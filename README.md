# Activity Finder ðŸŽ‰

## Description

Activity Finder is a simple web application built using Express.js and EJS that helps you find random activities based on certain criteria. The application fetches random activities from an external API and allows users to filter activities by type and number of participants. Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the API, and the retrieved activities are rendered on the webpage using an EJS template.
